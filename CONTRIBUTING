I understand. You want to add a link to your contribution guide lines on the top of the “pulls” page of your GitHub repository. According to the GitHub documentation1, you need to create a file named CONTRIBUTING.md in the root directory of your repository. This file will contain the text that you want to show up as your contribution guide lines. You can use Markdown syntax to format your text, such as headings, lists, links, and code blocks. For example, you can write something like this in your CONTRIBUTING.md file:

# Contributing to my-project
